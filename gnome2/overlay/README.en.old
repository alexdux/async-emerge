  How to add a package to your local copy of the overlay
  ======================================================
  It's not tested but should be ok.
  (If you are using a package that it is not listed in the overlay you can consider
  to add that package to it. Please at first try to do it locally, at your machine.)
  
  1. Add the package with mask to the gnome3 mask file 
      '/var/lib/layman/gnome2/profiles/packages.mask/gnome3'
  2. # cd /var/lib/layman/gnome2/scripts/
     # collect-packages.sh
  3. rebuild the package if necessary
  4. check it and feedback me to include it to the overlay (if you want to share it)
  
  (In case of a problem - just resync the overlay)
