#summary How to watch AE logs.

* draft *

All paths are given for default configuration! 

Nothing new - just reminders that could help someone ;) 

=Logs naming and location=
By default all AE logs are stored in one dir `/var/log/async.emerge`.<br>
By default all log files have 1 or 2 prefixes indicating different stages of AE:
  * `last.` - logs from last calling a tool
  * `cook.` - logs from last calling `ae_makeworld` in VCS environment
  * `install.` - same for GRS
By default all log files have `.log` 'extension'.

=Useful tools=

It is recomended to install `xtail`:
<code># emerge -av xtail</code>


=Top-level logging of cronned activity of AE=

<code># tailf /var/log/async.emerge/last.cron.log</code>

(`Ctrl+C` to stop.)


=Middle-level logging of AE tools activity= 

<code># xtail /var/log/async.emerge/last.`*`</code> 
(`Ctrl+\` to stop.)


=Low-level logging of portage activity= 

<code># xtail /var/log/portage/ /var/async.emerge/delta/var/log/portage/</code> 
(`Ctrl+\` to stop.) 

First path is for GRS, second - for VCS.


=View many logs with colors=

For example:
<code># less -r last.co`*`</code>
(in `less` type `:n` - next file, `:p` - prev file, `-S` - warp/unwarp long lines.)
