#summary How to install AE.

* draft 2 *

= AE Installation =

There are 3 simple steps to install async-emerge (AE). Fourth step is just the test if it is working. Fifth step is the cron configuration task. Finer configuration will be described in "Configuration" section...
 
 
= 1. ...for really old Gentoo box =

  * Sync the portage and update your package manager (portage by default).
  * Check with 'emerge -uDNvp world' (or similar) if all keywords/USE/mask is OK. Correct if necessary.

= 2. Add AE Overlay to Portage =

Add AE repo:
  * With layman (recommended way). Install layman if not installed yet:
<code># emerge -av layman</code>
(Make sure 'source /you/layman/overlay/dir' is included and uncommented in your /etc/make.conf.)

Edit layman's config, add ae-repo to layman:
<code># nano /etc/layman/layman.cfg
  overlays  : http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/repositories.xml 
+             https://async-emerge.googlecode.com/svn/distfiles/layman/ae-overlay.xml
</code>

Sync the layman overlays list:
<code># layman -l</code>

Add AE overlay:
<code># layman -a async-emerge</code>

Check if it available:
<code># eix async-emerge</code>
 

= 3. Unmask & install AE =

If you want to use the lastest development version do:
<code># echo "app-portage/async-emerge" > /etc/portage/package.keywords/async-emerge</code>
If you want to use the lastest SVN version do:
<code># echo "app-portage/async-emerge `**`" > /etc/portage/package.keywords/async-emerge</code>

*Finally, install AE.*
<code># emerge -av -j1 app-portage/async-emerge</code>
 

= 4. Optional: testing =

Try to start VCS with "df -h" command:
<code># ae_vcs df -h </code>

= 5. Add AE to cron =

In order to build (cook) in background binaries of packages updates you have to schedule `ae_cron` task:
  * Edit cron table:
<code># crontab -e
`30 22 * * *	/usr/bin/ae_cron -sm root@mymail.com`</code>

  * ...or edit anacron table:
<code># nano /etc/anacrontab</code>
Recommended frequency of running: once at 1-7 days. Anacron is suggested for rare used Gentoo boxes.
